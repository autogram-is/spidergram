# Config Directory

Spidergram stores assorted configuration data here, specifically google-oauth.json and google-token.json which are used for communicating with Google Analytics and the Pagespeed Insights API.

If you want Spidergram to pull analytics data into the graph, you'll need to set up the google-oauth.json file. If not, don't sweat it.
