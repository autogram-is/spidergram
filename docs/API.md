# Spidergram API

Spidergram was originally designed to be a "pure API;" its confiuration system and CLI commands were added later when it became clear just how much could be done without custom code. Although they accomplish a lot, creating your own NodeJS project and using Spidergram as an API can still be useful if you need:

- Complete control over how crawling and analysis tasks are performed
- Customized integration with third-party CLI tools and APIs during the analysis process
- New kinds of relationships or entities ('Business Units' or 'CMS Posts') in the data model
- Analysis of "app-like" web sites where users perform complex in-page tasks rather than simply following links
